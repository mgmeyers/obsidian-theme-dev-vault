# Footnotes

This is a sentence.[^FN1]

[^FN1]: This is a footnote. 

Here's a simple footnote,[^1] and here's a longer one.[^bignote]

You can also use inline footnotes. ^[notice that the carat goes outside of the brackets on this one.]

### Rendered examples

This was sneaky to capture. Note the footnotes are rendered, ya know, at the bottom.

> ![[ebullientworks-footnotes.png]] <cite>ebullientworks</cite>
%% next %%

> ![[ITS-footnotes.png]] <cite>ITS Theme</cite>
%% next %%

> ![[Sanctum-footnotes.png]] <cite>Sanctum</cite>

[^1]: meaningful!

[^bignote]: Here's one with multiple paragraphs and code.

    Indent paragraphs to include them in the footnote.

    `{ my code }`
	
    Add as many paragraphs as you like.
